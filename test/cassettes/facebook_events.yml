        presents the North American debut of PHOTON, Ben Klock\u2019s boundary-pushing
        event series Saturday, April 28 in the Great Hall at Avant Gardner Brooklyn.
        The Klockworks label boss will deliver his incendiary blend of heart-pounding
        and emotive techno alongside fellow Berghain resident MARCEL DETTMANN, prolific
        producer Dax J and Ukrainian virtuoso Etapp Kyle.  Influenced by the notion
        of a photon, the spectacular PHOTON series combines unique sound, light, and
        architecture to present a multi-sensory experience in a meticulously-curated
        space.\n\nLocated in the heart of Brooklyn\u2019s industrial center, the cavernous
        15,000 square foot Great Hall within the Avant Gardner event complex, also
        home to the beloved Brooklyn Mirage, is the perfect location to introduce
        the mesmeric interplay of PHOTON light and sound to the North American audience.
        Avant Gardner will join the ranks of prestigious venues that have hosted PHOTON
        including Printworks London and Amsterdam\u2019s Gashouder. The production
        team at OUTPUT will transform the Great Hall, bringing their standard of excellence
        to the impressive space including 300 lighting fixtures, a massive Kv2 sound

        \ud83d\udeb2 \ud83d\udeb2\n\nFeaturing...\n\nMusic\n- The Wonder Bars\nAn
        electronic band from Philadelphia employing real musicians, live theatrics
        and spontaneous improvisation. Focused on bringing a live element to the EDM
        culture, The Wonder Bars, Tom, Timmy, Ryan, and Ray, have been a staple of
        the Philadelphia underground for the past five years. Their superb musicianship
        and production work, however, are only being discovered today by a new generation
        of electronic music fans that are eager for a change in the status quo of
        DJs and club parties, thanks to a recent push in releas. In their native Philadelphia,
        however, the band is well known for playing some of the city''s most legendary
        underground and mainstream venues, as well as hosting their own parties whose
        acts also emphasize the crossover between live music and DJing.\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/wonderbars\/sets\/debut-album\n\n-
        DEL\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/a-DEL-mix\nOne of Philadelphia''s pioneering
        funky house DJs, DEL has been getting dance floors pregnant since before we
        were all in diapers. His soulful, groovy track selection is common amongst
        the end-of-summer rooftop parties that currently dominate our local scene,
        and his collaborations with Davidson Ospina (as well as his own solo edits
        of old disco tracks) have earned him acclaim far past the city limits. DEL''s
        DO YOU WANNA BOOGIE? party is a staple of the Winter Music Conference \/ Miami
        Music Week every year, and certainly gets us jealous for not being able to
        make it down there yet!\n\n- Tommy Hogunz\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/tommy_hogunz\n\nLive

        MELERA\n\nFor the past decade, the Amsterdam based Miss Melera has been absorbing
        the essence behind traditional genres such as deep, tech house and techno
        and twisting them into a melodic confection that is both fresh, timeless and
        completely her own.\nIn the past years she has played high profile dates in
        Europe, Asia, South and North America. In 2012 she has started her monthly
        radio show and event called ''COLOURIZON''. Her show is broadcast on several
        radio stations worldwide and increasingly popular on her Soundcloud profile.
        \nAs COLOURIZON developed quickly into a global phenomenon, Miss Melera was
        invited to play to\nin front of her fans all over the world. The success of
        the radio broadcast turned into a successful touring career, with invites
        to perform in famous venues like D-Edge (Sao Paulo, Brazil), Warung\n(Itaja\u00ed,
        Brazil), Womb (Tokyo, Japan), KaterBlau (Berlin, Germany), Oval Space\/Pickle
        Factory (London, UK), Le Bikini (Toulouse, France), Rote Fabrik (Zurich, Swiss),
        Harry Klein (Munchen,\nGermany), Niceto (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Nest (Toronto,
        Canada), Baum (Bogota, Colombia) and of course her Dutch hometown Amsterdam
        where she is hosting a COLOURIZON residency at De Marktkantine.\nHer fast-growing
        fanbase is embracing her latest release, \u2018Nirvana\u2019 on the English
        label Polymath which follows after a remix on Traum and her EP \u2018Magenta\u2019
        on Chapter 24 Records - including remixes by Dave Seaman and Jonas Saalbach.\nWith

        Eelke Kleijn,\nOlivier Weiter & Arjuna Schiks on the WEITER label, Chapter
        24 Records, Traum, Polymath and her upcoming tour schedule, Miss Melera will
